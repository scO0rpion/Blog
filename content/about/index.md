## About Me

![me](/images/navid.png)

My name is Navid Ardeshir and I am a Statistics Ph.D. student at [Columbia University](http://stat.columbia.edu) who has a strong desire to explore mathematical objects beyond my level of understanding. I earned my bachelors in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University which gave me a wonderful opportunity to work with [Kasra Alishahi](http://math.sharif.ir/faculties/alishahi) and [Amin Gohari](http://sharif.ir/~aminzadeh/). 

I have an eclectic taste in science and always try to nitpick in variety of areas since I believe novel ideas were invented once before by someone else in some other field and reinventing the wheel is an act of blasphemy in modern science! The purpose of this blog is mostly to document interesting subjects that I have encountered through my insignificant journey.
